                <h6>NFT (NON–Fungible Token)</h6>
                <p>
                NFTs are the unique tokens that represent the digital asset in real-world objects
like music, video, art, game items, and house. They can have an only a valid
owner at a time and they are secured on the Ethereum blockchain – once it is
on the blockchain no one can modify the copyright of the owner or cannot even
copy/past new NFT into existing NFT.
<br />
<br />
NFT is extended as a non-fungible token. Non-fungible is the economic term that
you can use to describe real-world objects like cars, furniture, and DVDs. These
objects cannot be changed because they have different properties.</p>
<br />
<h5>Unique attributes of NFT</h5>
                <h6>Invisibility</h6>
                <p>NFTs cannot be divided when it comes to their utility. For example, a plane ticket
cannot be purchased and used partially – someone must buy it fully because
only a single person can use the seat.

            </div>
            <div className="col-lg-6">
            <h6>Scarcity</h6>
                <p>The creator of an NFT gets to decide the scarcity of their asset. Though
developers can generate as many assets as they like, it is equally within their
power to limit the number of NFTs for scarcity.</p>
                <h6>Liquidity</h6>
                <p>It's one non-fungible token that can be traded at a non-stop regime. That is
why there is high liquidity in these markets. A great range of customers is there
who might be interested in buying.</p>
                <h6>Royalty</h6>
                <p>NFT royalties give you a percentage of the sales price each time your NFT
creation is sold on the market. NFT royalty payments are permanent and are
made through smart contracts automatically</p>
                <h6>Uniqueness</h6>
                <p>Creating an NFT token with unique product identity and authentication of
ownership for NFT companies makes NFTs a reliable tool to challenge the
duplication of products.</p>

                <p>Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an emerging financial technology based on a
secure distributed ledger similar to the other cryptocurrencies used. This DeFi
helps in removing the system like control banks and institutions have no money,
financial products, and financial products.
<br />
Decentralized finance is referred to as DeFi and DeFi helps in eliminating the fees
that the third party like banks, settlement, and financial companies charge for
using their services.

            <h5>The Finance World Before DeFi</h5>
            <p>In centralized finance, your money is held by banks, corporations whose
overarching goal is to make money. The financial system is full of third parties
who facilitate money movement between parties, with each one charging fees
for using their services.

            Cryptocurrency wallets are apps just like you use on your smartphone and
computer. A Crypto wallet stores your private keys and to access those private
keys or the cryptocurrency you needed to give the password. You can access
your wallet safely and securely to transfer currency like Ethereum and Bitcoin.
<br />
Crypto wallet comes in different forms like a paper wallet, online wallet, and
hard wallet. Unlike your normal wallet, which can hold cash, crypto wallets don’t
store the crypto. It will live on blockchain but it can be accessed using only
private. A common example of can cryptocurrency wallet is MetaMask.

            <p>A smart contract audit is an extensive methodical examination and analysis of a
smart contract’s code that is used to interact with a cryptocurrency or
blockchain. The smart contract is conducted to discover the security
vulnerabilities, errors, and issues in the smart contract code in order to improve
the code and fix the errors.<br /> <br />
Smart contract testing is very complicated because smart contract often
interacts with each other and any envelopment of a third party can result in
system vulnerability. Therefore, testing is often extended to other smart
contracts where they interact with another smart contract under testing.

              The database or backend is the part that remains on the Ethereum network and
which connects to the frontend to provide the necessary function. The backend
is built using smart contracts, which is the just code that executes on the
blockchain network. We use the backend for integration with other existing
technologies and services. Real, world applications cannot live in an isolated
environment.
<br />

                <br />
                We use the backend to process and store anything large enough for the
decentralized network in the particular blockchain. And the business logic and
the whole application are stored somewhere in the world excluding only the
blockchain part. We have the IPFS which is a decentralized, per-to-per file
sharing protocol. IPFS network runs on the web and uses content-address
storage (CAS) to store the data and retrieve based on its content.

              What is metaverse
              </h5>
              <p>
              Metaverse is an extensive online world where people interact through digital
avatars, who can do everything virtually – buy goods and services, go to work,
attend events, and more. Metaverse can potentially transform the way people
engage digitally, driving the progression from chatting apps and social media
platforms to a multidimensional space where people can engage more
interactively.

                <br />
                <br />
                The global metaverse market is expected to grow from $107.1 billion in 2020 to
$758.6 billion by 2026. The potential of the metaverse is attributed to the
growing interest of people in blockchain metaverse development. Many
corporate giants like Facebook, Microsoft, Nike, Reebok, and more are investing
in metaverse development solutions to provide ingenious offerings to their
customers.

            Frontend Development
            </h5>
            <p>
            A front-end developer builds the front-end portion of websites and web
applications—that is, the part that users actually see and interact with. A frontend developer creates websites and applications using web languages such as
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allowing users to access and interact with the site or
app. Contrast this with back-end developers, who work to develop the behindthe-scenes portions of a website or application, like data storage, security, site
performance, or other server-side functions.
<br />
<br />
The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the
site, they see the information in a format that is easy to read and relevant. This
is further complicated by the fact that users now use a large variety of devices
with varying screen sizes and resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into
consideration these aspects when designing the site.
<br />
<br />
They need to ensure that their site comes up correctly in different browsers
(cross-browser), different operating systems (cross-platform), and different
devices (cross-device), which requires careful planning on the side of the
developer.

              Cryptocurrencies offer the potential to provide more secure, accelerated, and
transparent transactions.
<br />
A cryptocurrency or coin is a digital currency designed to work as a medium of
exchange through a computer network that is not reliant on any central
authority, such as government or bank, to update or maintain it.
<br />
<br />
These digital currencies are not only augmenting the financial industry but also
making financial services accessible to anyone across the globe. An increasing
number of users worldwide are using cryptocurrencies for a variety of
transactional and investment purposes.

              The original coin, Bitcoin is the first digital currency and is not controlled by
any central authority. In its initial time, the currency faced certain resistance
but was gradually adopted by the people worldwide. Its idea was to eliminate
double spending amounts, while waiting for confirmation the payments – a
transaction becomes irreversible with the increasing number of verifications

              <p>
              Altcoins are generally defined as all cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin (BTC).
However, some people consider altcoins to be all cryptocurrencies other than
Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) because most cryptocurrencies are forked from
one of the two. Some altcoins use different consensus mechanisms to validate
transactions and open new blocks or attempt to distinguish themselves from
Bitcoin and Ethereum by providing new or additional capabilities or purposes.

              <p>
              Tokens do not have their own blockchain; they are built on an already existing
blockchain. Tokens can represent all kinds of assets – from goods to a brandnew cryptocurrency. They are created by employing a standard token creation
standard and distributed by ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) and STOs (Security
Token Offerings) – which are basically crowdfunding solutions for a new
project. If you are not sure which type of cryptocurrency you want to launch,
our consulting solutions can help you make well-informed decisions.
