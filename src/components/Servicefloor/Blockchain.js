            <h5>Blockchain development</h5>
            <p>
              Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the
              process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a
              business network. An asset can be tangible (a house, car, cash,
              land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights,
              branding).

              <h6>Immutable</h6>
              <p>
                Immutability means that the blockchain is a permanent and
                unalterable network. Blockchain technology functions through a
                collection of nodes.
              </p>
              <h6>Distributed</h6>
              <p>
                All network participants have a copy of the ledger for complete
                transparency. A public ledger will provide complete information
                about all the participants on the network and transactions. The
                distributed computational power across the computers ensures a
                better outcome. Distributed ledger is one of the important
                features of blockchains
              </p>
              <h6>Decentralized</h6>
              <p>
                All the records in the blockchain are individually encrypted.
                Using encryption adds another layer of security to the entire
                process on the blockchain network. Since there is no central
                authority, it does not mean that one can simply add, update or
                delete data on the network.
              </p>
              <h6>Unanimous</h6>
              <p>
                All the network participants agree to the validity of the
                records before they can be added to the network. When a node
                wants to add a block to the network then it must get majority
                voting otherwise the block cannot be added to the network.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div className="col-lg-5">
              <h6>Secure</h6>
              <p>
                Creating an NFT token with unique product identity and
                authentication of ownership for NFT companies makes NFTs a
                reliable tool to challenge the duplication of products.
              </p>

              <h6>Consensus</h6>
              <p>
                Every blockchain has a consensus to help the network to make
                quick and unbiased decisions. Consensus is a decision-making
                algorithm for the group of nodes active on the network to reach
                an agreement quickly and faster and for the smooth functioning
                of the system.
              </p>
              <h6>Faster Settlement</h6>
              <p>
                Traditional banking systems are prone to many reasons for
                fallout like taking days to process a transaction after
                finalizing all settlements, which can be corrupted easily. On
                the other hand, blockchain offers a faster settlement compared
                to traditional banking systems.
