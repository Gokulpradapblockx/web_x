            <h5>Smart Contract Audit and Testing</h5>
            <p>
              A smart contract audit is an extensive methodical examination and
              analysis of a smart contractâ€™s code that is used to interact with
              a cryptocurrency or blockchain. The smart contract is conducted to
              discover the security vulnerabilities, errors, and issues in the
              smart contract code in order to improve the code and fix the
              errors.Smart contract testing is very complicated because smart
              contract often interacts with each other and any envelopment of a
              third party can result in system vulnerability. Therefore, testing
              is often extended to other smart contracts where they interact
              with another smart contract under testing.
