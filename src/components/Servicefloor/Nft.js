              <h5>NFT (NON–Fungible Token)</h5>
              <p>
                NFTs are the unique tokens that represent the digital asset in
                real-world objects like music, video, art, game items, and
                house. They can have an only a valid owner at a time and they
                are secured on the Ethereum blockchain – once it is on the
                blockchain no one can modify the copyright of the owner or
                cannot even copy/past new NFT into existing NFT.

                <h6>Indivisibility</h6>
                <p>
                  NFTs cannot be divided when it comes to their utility. For
                  example, a plane ticket cannot be purchased and used partially
                  – someone must buy it fully because only a single person can
                  use the seat.
                </p>
                <h6>Liquidity</h6>
                <p>
                  It's one non-fungible token that can be traded at a non-stop
                  regime. That is why there is high liquidity in these markets.
                  A great range of customers is there who might be interested in
                  buying.
                </p>
                <h6>Uniqueness</h6>
                <p>
                  Creating an NFT token with unique product identity and
                  authentication of ownership for NFT companies makes NFTs a
                  reliable tool to challenge the duplication of products.

              <div className="col-lg-5">
                <h6>Scarcity</h6>
                <p>
                  The creator of an NFT gets to decide the scarcity of their
                  asset. Though developers can generate as many assets as they
                  like, it is equally within their power to limit the number of
                  NFTs for scarcity.
                </p>
                <h6>Royalty</h6>
                <p>
                  NFT royalties give you a percentage of the sales price each
                  time your NFT creation is sold on the market. NFT royalty
                  payments are permanent and are made through smart contracts
                  automatically
