          A front-end developer builds the front-end portion of websites and web applicationsâ€”that is, the part that users actually see and interact with. A frontend developer creates websites and applications using web languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allowing users to access and interact with the site or app. Contrast this with back-end developers, who work to develop the behindthe-scenes portions of a website or application, like data storage, security, site performance, or other server-side functions.

The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the site, they see the information in a format that is easy to read and relevant. This is further complicated by the fact that users now use a large variety of devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into consideration these aspects when designing the site.

They need to ensure that their site comes up correctly in different browsers (cross-browser), different operating systems (cross-platform), and different devices (cross-device), which requires careful planning on the side of the developer.
