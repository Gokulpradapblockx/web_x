                <h6>Bitcoin</h6>
                <p>
                The original coin, Bitcoin is the first digital currency and is not controlled by any central authority. In its initial time, the currency faced certain resistance but was gradually adopted by the people worldwide. Its idea was to eliminate double spending amounts, while waiting for confirmation the payments – a transaction becomes irreversible with the increasing number of verifications.
                </p>
                <h6>Altcoins</h6>
                <p>
                Altcoins are generally defined as all cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin (BTC). However, some people consider altcoins to be all cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) because most cryptocurrencies are forked from one of the two. Some altcoins use different consensus mechanisms to validate transactions and open new blocks or attempt to distinguish themselves from Bitcoin and Ethereum by providing new or additional capabilities or purposes.

                <h6>Tokens</h6>
                <p>
                Tokens do not have their own blockchain; they are built on an already existing blockchain. Tokens can represent all kinds of assets – from goods to a brandnew cryptocurrency. They are created by employing a standard token creation standard and distributed by ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) and STOs (Security Token Offerings) – which are basically crowdfunding solutions for a new project. If you are not sure which type of cryptocurrency you want to launch, our consulting solutions can help you make well-informed decisions.
