              Cryptocurrency wallets are apps just like you use on your
              smartphone and computer. A Crypto wallet stores your private keys
              and to access those private keys or the cryptocurrency you needed
              to give the password. You can access your wallet safely and
              securely to transfer currency like Ethereum and Bitcoin. Crypto
              wallet comes in different forms like a paper wallet, online
              wallet, and hard wallet. Unlike your normal wallet, which can hold
              cash, crypto wallets donâ€™t store the crypto. It will live on
              blockchain but it can be accessed using only private. A common
              example of can cryptocurrency wallet is MetaMask.
