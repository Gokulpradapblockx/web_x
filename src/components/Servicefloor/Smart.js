            <h5>Smart contract </h5>
            <p>
              A smart contract is a self-executing contract with terms of
              agreements between the buyer and seller which is written in the
              form of code and it is simple code that runs on the blockchain and
              resides on a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain. The
              smart contract is the type of Ethereum account. This means they
              have a balance and they send the transaction over different
              networks. They are deployed to the network and run
              programmatically and they cannot be controlled by the user. Where
              users can only interact with smart contracts. Smart contracts once
              deployed on the blockchain they cannot be altered or removed and
              interaction with them is irreversible from the blockchain.
